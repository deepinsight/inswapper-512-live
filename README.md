# inswapper-512-live

*The initial test version is scheduled for release around **February 11th**. Currently, efforts are focused on optimizing the Mac app user interface and conducting standardization tests on model metrics.*


## Introduction

**``inswapper-512-live``** is an ultra-lightweight face swapping model that provides native 512x512 resolution. Compared to the ``inswapper_128`` model, it requires less than one-tenth of the computational complexity while being capable of producing results with 16 times the pixel output (512x512 vs 128x128).
